ReadMe

Hello, Reader! This is a readme file for Roshini Sreenivas's capstone project that was submitted for BrainStation's Data Science bootcamp September-December 2021. It will serve as a quick guide for how to navigate the documents in the folder. 

The focus on this project was to use a time series analysis to forecast when the Yield for a crop tends to zero based on Environmental Stress data like Emissions and Sea level rise. 

The Rsreeni_Capstone folder contains the following:

- 1 readme file
- 1 folder titled "CapstoneData" that contains:
	- 5 CSV files containing all the different data sets I've downloaded for the purpose of this analysis
	- 1 CSV file called df2_banana-cleaned to use in the Tableau workbook 
- 1 Jupyter Notebook, the code from the beginning to the end
- 1 Technical Summary Report in PDF format
- 1 Tableau Workbook that contains all the visuals built for analysis and the dashboard

PLEASE NOTE: The Tableau workbook should only be opened after you've run the Jupyter notebooks till the file is exported to work on Tableau. I have also included this cleaned notebook with the CSVs. Its called df2_banana-cleaned. 

NOTE ALSO THAT: The Jupyter Notebook takes about 20 minutes to run from top to bottom on my machine. 

All files in this notebook can be run in the base anaconda environment (Python 3 kernel).

If you are having trouble accessing any of the files within this folder please contact Roshini Sreenivas at rosh.2992@gmail.com. 

Thank you for your attention! You may now proceed to the notebook!
